This project was created in cooperation with the [Complexity Science Hub Vienna](https://www.csh.ac.at/) and the support of my fast-responding and motived mentors [Max Pellert](https://www.csh.ac.at/researcher/max-pellert/) and [David Garcia](https://www.csh.ac.at/researcher/david-garcia/).

The qualitative extraction of the narratives investigated was possible through the cooperation and work of the Austrian fakt-checking webiste [mimikama.at](https://www.mimikama.at/).

Another thanks goes to Manuel Müller for his ideas and inspirations concerning statistical methods and their practical applications and to Surya Knöbel for his content recommendations and inputs.
