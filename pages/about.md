My name is Constanze Leeb and I am currently studying [Cognitive Science](https://www.meicogsci.eu/) and [Physics](https://physik.univie.ac.at/en/) in my masters at the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/en/).

Beforehand I studied Sociology and Physics in my bachelors also at the University of Vienna.

Through the content of courses about Complex Systems I became fascinated with the content and phenomenon of networks.
