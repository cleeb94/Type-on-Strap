My name is Constanze Leeb and I am currently studying Cognitive Science and Physics in my masters at the University of Vienna.

Beforehand I studied Sociology and Physics in my bachelors also at the University of Vienna.

Through the content of courses about Complex Systems I became fascinated with the content and phenomenon of networks.
