My name is Constanze Leeb and I am currently studying Cognitive Science and Physics in my masters at the University of Vienna.

Beforehand I studied Sociology and Physics in my bachelors also at the University of Vienna.

Through the content of courses about Complex Systems I became fascinated with the content and phenomenon of networks.

This project was created in cooperation with the [Complexity Science Hub Vienna](https://www.csh.ac.at/) with my mentors [David Garcia](https://www.csh.ac.at/researcher/david-garcia/) and [Max Pellert](https://www.csh.ac.at/researcher/max-pellert/).
